I was unable to run the tests automatically due to environment restrictions.

I have analyzed the home screen code and created a new, more comprehensive test file at `test/home_screen_test.dart`. This new test file verifies the UI elements of the home screen, such as the AppBar, the bottom navigation bar, and the business list sheet. I have also created a report in `TEST_RESULTS.md` that explains the new test.

To run the new test, you can use the following command in your terminal:
`flutter test test/home_screen_test.dart`

Please run the new test in your local environment to fully verify the home screen.
